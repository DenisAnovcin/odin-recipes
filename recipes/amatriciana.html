        <h2>Amatriciana, an italian delicacy, one of the four Roman pastas!</h2>
        <p>Amatriciana is a traditional Italian pasta sauce that originates from the town of Amatrice, located in the Lazio region of Italy. The sauce is made with a few key ingredients—guanciale (cured pork cheek), tomatoes, and Pecorino Romano cheese—offering a rich and savory flavor profile. It is most commonly served with spaghetti or bucatini, a thicker, hollow pasta that holds the sauce beautifully.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g pasta (spaghetti/bucatini/rigatoni)</li>
            <li>200g guanciale</li>
            <li>400g canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>100g Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>1 small onion (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>salt an pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the packaging information.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat (if using). Add the guanciale and sauté until it becomes golden brown and crispy. This should take about 5–7 minutes. If you prefer a more intense flavor, let the guanciale render out some fat.</li>
            <li>If you're using onions, add them to the pan with the guanciale and cook until softened (about 2–3 minutes). Add the red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for another 30 seconds to release their flavor. Pour in the canned tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes) and stir. If you like, add a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any crispy bits from the bottom. Allow the sauce to simmer on low heat for about 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is ready, add the drained pasta directly into the pan with the sauce. Toss everything together, adding a little reserved pasta water if the sauce seems too dry. The starchy water will help the sauce cling to the pasta.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Toss until the cheese melts and the sauce coats the pasta evenly.</li>
            <li>Plate the pasta and, if desired, sprinkle more Pecorino Romano on top. Add a dash of freshly ground black pepper for extra flavor, and serve immediately!</li>
        </ol>
