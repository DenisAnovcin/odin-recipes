        <h2>Aglio e Olio, an italian delicacy that will fill you with delicious garlic!</h2>
        <p>Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian pasta dish that originated in Naples. It features a simple combination of garlic (aglio), olive oil (olio), red pepper flakes, and pasta, typically spaghetti. The garlic is gently saut√©ed in olive oil until fragrant, then tossed with the cooked pasta and red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. It's often finished with a sprinkle of parsley and grated Parmesan, though the latter is optional. The dish is known for its bold, savory flavors and is a quick and easy favorite among pasta lovers.</p>
